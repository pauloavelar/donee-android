# donee [DEMO] - Privacy Policy

The app requires the same permissions as the full version, but its behavior is restricted to local and standalone for demonstration of donee's features. Therefore, **no data** is uploaded to servers, ours or otherwise. Feel free to check the source code.

The following permissions are required. These are the reasons for their inclusion **in the full version**:

* **Internet:** for communicating with donee's servers;
* **Read Phone State:** for collecting the IMEI as a device identifier for each session;
* **Read External Storage:** for accessing photos in image fields;
* **Access Fine Location:** for geolocation-enabled forms. This permission is requested in-app.

**No data is collected in the demo version.** Please [contact me](mailto:contact@pauloavelar.com) if you want more information.
